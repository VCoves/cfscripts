# CfScripts - a collection of scripts for CodeForces
`cfscripts` is a collection of scripts for [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com) that uses the [CodeForces API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp).

## âœ¨ Scripts
`cfscripts` currently includes the following scripts:

* **Comulative AC count**
    - Count how many problems were solved since a specific date.

* **Daily ACs**
    - Finds problems solved on each day along with their rating.

* **Range rank**
    - In an official contest, where did you rank among the contestants within a given rating range around your rating (the rating at the time of participating).

* **Unsolved Contest Problems**
    - Find unsolved problems from contests, where you have made at least one submission in the contest. Why? Because you don't want to spoil nice unsolved virtuals, when you just solve problems from the problemset. It handles div1/div2 contests where a problem occurs in both.

* **Virtual Performance**
    - Calculate rank/delta/performance of virtual/unofficial/official contests.

* **What if?**
    - What If Codeforces virtual contests / unofficial participations were official? Calculates new ratings using deltas and simulates the past `n` contests.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
`cfscripts` can be *installed* in two different ways.
* You can download a pre-compiled binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/willthbill/cfscripts/releases).
* You can clone this repository and set up the development environment (see the [development section](#Development)). Then it should be as easy as running `pipenv run cfscripts`.

On linux you may optionally create an alias for the `cfscripts` executable, or add its location to the `PATH` variable.

## ðŸš€ Usage
* Run the executable
```
$ ./cfscripts
```
* If you are using the development environment then check out the [pipenv development workflow section](#pipenv-development-environment).

When running `cfscripts` it will ask you to choose a script, and the script will guide you from there.

## ðŸ’» Development 
The following sections explain the various parts of the project from a development perspective.

### Prerequisites
* `pipenv`
* `python3`
* `bash`

### Directory Structure
* `src` should contain all source code, including scripts.
    - `src/lib` contains library code for interacting with the CodeForces API.
    - `src/scripts` contains a directory for each script.
* `devtools` contains devops scripts.

### Pipenv Development Environment

`cfscripts` is written in `python` and uses `pipenv`.
Install `python` dependencies using:
```bash
$ pipenv install
```
Run `cfscripts` without building using:
```bash
$ pipenv run cfscripts
```
Run a specific script directory without building using (see `Pipfile` for script-names in the `[scripts]` section):
```bash
$ pipenv run <script-name>
``` 
To add a pip-package to the environment use:
```
$ pipenv install <package-name>
```
You may also activate the `pipenv` environment using:
```
$ pipenv shell
```
Then you can run any python file directly.

### Building

* Run `pipenv run build`.
* `_dist` will then contain an executable for each script and `cfscripts`.
* `bin` will contain the `cfscripts` executable.

### Creating a Script
* Scripts should preferably be written in python, however scripts may be written in any language (see `src/main.py` and `scripts/build.sh`).
* When adding a script you should create a directory in `src/scripts` with the script name, and the files used by the script should be placed within this directory.
* Then you should add a pipenv-script in the Pipfile's `[scripts]` section to run the script using pipenv (this applies to scripts in other languages as well).
* In order to run the script through `cfscripts` you should add an entry in the `script_configs` list in `src/main.py`, each entry is a tuple of the form (name, function/command, description, credit).
* Lastly, you can add a line in `scripts/build.sh` for building the script into an single executable.
