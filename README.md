# cftools
cftools is a collection of scripts for CodeForces (https://codeforces.com) that uses the CodeForces API (https://codeforces.com/apiHelp).

# Scripts
cftools currently include the following scripts:

* **Comulative AC count**: *Count how many problems solved since a spefific date.*
* **Daily ACs**: *Finds problems solved on each day along with their rating.*
* **Range rank**: *In an official contest, where did you rank among the contestants within a given rating range around your rating (the rating at the time of participating).*
* **Unsolved Contest Problems**: *Find unsolved problems from contests with at least one submission. Why? Because you don't want to spoil nice unsolved virtuals. Handles div1/div2 contests where a problem occurs in both.*
* **Virtual Performance**: *Calculate rank/delta/performance of virtual/unofficial/offical contests.*
* **What if?**: *What If Codeforces virtual contests / unofficial participations were official? Calculates new ratings using deltas and simulates the past n contests.*
